    <h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) student specializing in Media & Information Technology, with a strong passion for UI/UX design, frontend development, and creative technology. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and code, where user experience and functionality come together.

I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and SQL, and I actively apply these skills through academic and personal projects. On the design side, I work with Figma and Canva to create wireframes, prototypes, and visually engaging interfaces that are user-focused and practical.

I have worked on projects such as quiz applications, web interfaces, and UI/UX case studies, where I focused on clean layouts, smooth user flow, and responsive design. These projects have helped me understand how good design decisions improve usability and overall product experience.

Currently, I am enhancing my skills through internships and self-learning, exploring areas like frontend frameworks, UI animations, and real-world application development. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy experimenting with new ideas, tools, and technologies.

I am looking for opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and grow as a UI/UX designer or frontend developer, while collaborating with creative and tech-driven teams.
